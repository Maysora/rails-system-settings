Description:
    The sysinfo_controller generator creates stubs for a new sysinfo controller
    and the show action. The sysinfo controller displays basic system, database
    and environment settings.

    The generator takes a controller name that will default to 'sysinfo' unless
    otherwise specified. Modules are specified by prefixing controller name
    with 'module/'.

    The generator creates a controller class in app/controllers with view
    templates in app/views/controller_name, and a functional test suite in
    test/functional.
