= system-settings plugin for Rails

system-settings is a plugin makes it easy to store application settings in the 
database as key-value pairs. The data is stored in a table named system_settings
with three columns; id, name and value.  The ActiveRecord model SystemSetting 
allows access to the settings via array functions such as;

SystemSetting['foo']                 # nil
SystemSetting['foo'] = 'bar'
SystemSetting['foo']                 # 'bar'

You can generate the migration, a test and a sample fixture by running the 
generator 'system_settings' via a command such as;

  ruby script/generate system_settings

This plugin can also ensure that the application constant RAILS_ENV matches the 
database environment by checking that SystemSetting['environment'] == RAILS_ENV.
When the environment does not match an exception is thrown.
